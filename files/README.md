# files

Provides static files that are used by the Ansible role.

These files can be installed to the managed nodes via the usage of [the `ansible.builtin.copy` module](https://docs.ansible.com/ansible/latest/collections/ansible/builtin/copy_module.html) and other modules that accept local files as an argument.
